# Online_food_order_prediction

📌 Project Overview

This project predicts whether a food delivery will be on-time or late based on key features like delivery distance, order time, weather, and traffic conditions. It is built using Python with a CSV dataset, and uses machine learning for classification.

🧠 Objectives

Analyze real-world food delivery data
Predict delivery status (on-time / late)
Use ML to assist in improving logistics and customer experience

📦 Technologies Used

Pandas – Data loading and preprocessing
NumPy – Numerical operations
Matplotlib / Seaborn – Data visualization
Scikit-learn – Model building and evaluation

📊 Features Used in Dataset

Delivery person ID

Delivery distance

Time of order and pickup

Weather conditions

Road traffic density

Delivery time taken

Delivery status (Target)

⚙️ ML Workflow
Load dataset (CSV)

Clean and preprocess data

Visualize key relationships

Encode categorical features

Train a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression or Random Forest)

Evaluate model with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Predict delivery status for new data
